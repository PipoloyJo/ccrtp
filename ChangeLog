2001-12-28  David Sugar <dufet@ostel.com> (from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2)

	* src/rtp.h: header fixups for newer Common C++

	* application of Debian patch for gcc 3.0.

2001-11-28  Federico Montesino <p5087@quintero.fie.us.es> (from 0.6.2 to 0.6.3)

	* src/members.cpp: fixed a bug in RTPSource::addNewSource(uint32)
	(the collision list was wrongly modified when inserting new
	sources).

	* src/queue.cpp: fixed a serious bug (incomplete initialization)
	in RTPQueue::RTPQueue(int, uint32) and RTPQueue::initQueue.

	* UDPIPv4Socket now inherits from both UDPReceive and UDPTransmit,
	instead of only UDPSocket. Inheriting only from UDPSocket is an
	error I introduced in 0.6.0. This change is necessary to avoid
	receiving/transmitting collisions, specially when two applications
	in the same host talk to each other through the same port numbers.
	
	* src/socket.cpp: UDPIPv4Socket::Connect(const InetAddress&,
	tpport_t) removed as a result of the change listed up here.
	
	* demo/Makefile.am, demo/rtpsend.cpp and demo/rtplisten.cpp: added
	new demo apps
	
	* COPYING.addendum: added (the same as the Common C++ one)

	* src/rtp.h: rearranged Members class.

	* src/control.cpp: QueueRTCPManager::getOnlyBye() has been filled
	in.
	
	* src/rtp.h, src/control.cpp: static const data members initialization
	moved from rtp.h to control.cpp to avoid VC++ complaints.

	* src/rtp.h: T_RTPSocket::leaveGroup(const InetMcastAddress&) fixed
	(now calls to setMulticast(false), instead of setMulticast(true)).

	* src/rtp.h: Template T_RTPSocket updated from __EXPORT to 
	CCXX_CLASS_EXPORT
	
	* src/rtp.h, control.cpp and packet.cpp: RTP_VERSION is now called
	CCRTP_VERSION to avoid name conflicts with other stacks

	* src/rtp.h and src/queue.h: the "data" parameter of putPacket is
	now const.

2001-11-27  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com> (from 0.7.0 to 0.7.1)
	* fixed memory leaks in sdes and bye string builds.
	* added functional virtuals for session control start and stop.
	* created start of "phone" user agent.

2001-10-14  E. Stuart Hicks <eshicks@hotmail.com> (from 0.6.1 to 0.6.2)
	* minor patch to compile on older gcc releases.

2001-10-07  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com> (from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1)
	* ccRTP becomes a GNU package.

2001-09-20  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com> (from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1)
	* new virtuals to trap and filter packet queue expiration.
	
2001-09-02  Federico Montesino <p5087@quintero.fie.us.es> (from 0.5.1 to 0.6.0)

	* configure.in: added check for nana support
	(configure --with-nana, for testing), stdlib.h and sys/utsname.h

	* src/Makefile.am: updated to make the following:

	* src/rtpext.h: new public header containing the declarations
	needed to make low level packet filtering and stack extensions.

	* rtp.h: many new methods and changes in the class hierarchy (to
	add MembershipControl, QueueRTCPManager and the template
	T_RTPSocket)

	* New files src/members.cpp, src/data.cpp and src/source.cpp with
	the implementation of MembershipControl, RTPData and RTPSource
	classes, respectively

	* src/control.cpp: now includes the implementation of
	QueueRTCPManager.

	* src/socket.cpp: now includes the implementation of UDPIPv4Socket
	and could include the implementation of other kind of socket
	classes used to instantiate T_RTPSocket.

	* Rearranged the doxygen tags and configuration (and changes in
	src/private.h) so that the introductory README, the TODO list and
	the examples under demo/ are included in the documentation. Added
	some comments both for API and implementation.

2001-08-22  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com> (from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1)

	* expose private packet structures externally.

	* added const for address handlers.
	* added queue Purge function.
	* extended queue i/o services and support for sequence and 
	  timestamp initialization/signatures.
	* added millisecond timeclock for stack time synhronization.
	* added RTCP event messages as virtuals.

2001-04-23  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com> (from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1)

	* added virtual handler for timer tick driven code.
	* added	patches and demo apps from Federico.
	
from 0.3.2 to 0.4.0  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* fixed version test.
	* added virtual handler to process packet "events".

from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* some win32 things.
	* new common c++ version check.

from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* some header fixups.

	* merged with Common C++ updates and new Common C++ UDP classes.

from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* use of sequence and marker checks to allow application to
	determine if assembled multi-sequence packets are "complete" or
	missing data.

	* reorganized class structure to allow more malleable assembly of
	different kinds of RTP session classes.

from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* add support to strip "padding" on receiver side.
	* add packet reassembly of multi-segment packets.
	* add getPayloadSize capability.

	a generic base for creating different RTP socket types.
	* RTPDuplex added.
