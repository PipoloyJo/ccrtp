2001-09-02  Federico Montesino <p5087@quintero.fie.us.es> (from 0.5.1 to 0.6.0)

	* configure.in: added check for nana support
	(configure --with-nana, for testing), stdlib.h and sys/utsname.h

	* src/Makefile.am: updated to make the following:

	* src/rtpext.h: new public header containing the declarations
	needed to make low level packet filtering and stack extensions.

	* rtp.h: many new methods and changes in the class hierarchy (to
	add MembershipControl, QueueRTCPManager and the template
	T_RTPSocket)

	* New files src/members.cpp, src/data.cpp and src/source.cpp with

	and could include the implementation of other kind of socket
	classes used to instantiate T_RTPSocket.

	* Rearranged the doxygen tags and configuration (and changes in
	src/private.h) so that the introductory README, the TODO list and
	the examples under demo/ are included in the documentation. Added
	some comments both for API and implementation.

	* new common c++ version check.

from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2  David Sugar <dyfet@ostel.com>

	* use of sequence and marker checks to allow application to
	determine if assembled multi-sequence packets are "complete" or
