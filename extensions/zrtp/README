This package provides a library that adds support to the GNU RTP stack 
for the ZRTP protocol specification developed by Phil Zimmermann for 
zfone.  Using this package, together with GNU ccrtp (1.5.0 or later) 
provides a ZRTP implimentation that can be directly embedded into client
and server applications, rather than the overhead penalty of using an 
external proxy such as zphone.  The first application to demonstrate 
this capability is the 0.8.2 release of the Twinkle softphone client.

Please note, this library is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 3 or 
later, and has been copyright assigned to the Free Software Foundation.
