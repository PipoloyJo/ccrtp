This package provides a library that adds support to the GNU RTP stack 
for the ZRTP protocol specification developed by Phil Zimmermann for 
zfone.  Using this package, together with GNU ccrtp (1.5.0 or later) 
provides a ZRTP implementation that can be directly embedded into client
and server applications.

The first application to demonstrate this capability is the 0.8.2 release 
of the Twinkle softphone client. All following version of Twinkle support
this as well.

Please note, this library is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 3 or 
later, and has been copyright assigned to the Free Software Foundation.

The ccRTP ZRTP implementation is compliant to the basic functions of
ZRTP as decsribed in "draft-zimmermann-avt-zrtp-06". Currently ccRTP ZRTP
does support the basic features only, not the enhacned feature like
SAS relaying and Multi-Stream mode. The ccRTP ZRTP implementation already
defined the necessary interfaces and functions fot these enhanced features
but they are not yet implemented.
