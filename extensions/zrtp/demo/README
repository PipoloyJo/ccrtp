This directory includes example programs intended for testing
and illustrating features of ccRTP and the ZRTP extension.

Before using these programs make sure that ccRTP is up and
working correctly.


* zrtptest: is similar to ccrtptest in ccRTP demo directory. This
  program shows how to use the class SymmetricZRTPSession instead
  of RTPSession. 

  This first test shows that SymmetricZRTPSession is compatible to
  RTPSession if it is used withou specific initialization or configuration.

  The second test initializes the ZRTP engine and starts it just before
  sending or receiving RTP data. The ZRTP engine does some prints to
  show how ZRTP proceeds and switches to secure mode.
  
  The third test shows how to use an application supplied callback class
  to control message printout, switching to secure mode, displaying
  the Short Authentication String (SAS).

To start the demo application you may open two shell (command) windows
and start "zrtptest -r" in one window first, then start "zrtptest -s"
in the second window.
