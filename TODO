- URGENT!!!: Fill the SR, RR and some SDES reports 

	- NTP - Timestamp  synchronization  (for end2end delay)

- Add user interface for RTP header extensions and CSRC specification

- Kitchen: playout delay compensation

- QueueRTCPManager::TimeOutSSRCs()

- RTPQueue::newTalkSpurt() -> M

- thoroughly check multicast support

- provide faster handling of sessions with one or few senders

- Filter PT field (RTQueue::setReceivedPayloadType)

- Add good exception handling

- good suport for RTP muxing - mixers and translators

- for video, timestamp must be determined from the frame number or from
the system clock.

- QueueRTCPManager::QueueRTCPManager(..): path MTU is always assumed to be 1500

	- path MTU discovery for RTCP (Arrggg, we use UDP!)

- check robust handling of payload change

- Add support for dynamic pts (BT656, H263-1998, MP1S, MP2P, BMPEG) 

- Address the enhanced/best-effort service issue

- queue.cpp: Improve random number generation

- members.cpp: a good hashing!

- Implement encryption support?

- Test ccRTP following RFC 3158: ``RTP Testing Strategies'', 


(Experimental things, close everything up here before looking down here)

* Implement SSRC sampling algorithm

* Consider SRTP profile, currently only immature draft
